    <h1>I went the bare maximum on the last page. So this will be the bare minimum</h1>
    <p>I remember there is a way to id certain elements so the computer could reflect on them quickly. I forgot it at the moment and will learn it soon. I believe the prompt needed three different additions to element.</p>

    <h2>Ingrediants</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Chicken</li>
        <li>Dumplings</li>
        <li>Salt because it goes with everything</li>
      </ul>

    <br>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>I am not sure on how to make them</li>
        <li>It was my favorite dish growing up</li>
        <li>My grandmother made them every once in a while</li>
        <li>My grandma died without teaching me the recipe</li>
        <li>So I will never eat Chicken and Dumplings like that again</li>
      </ol>
