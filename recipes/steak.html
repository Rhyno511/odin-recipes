      <p><strong>Steak</strong> has been a staple of eating since the beginning of time. Whether it be steaks from an <em>animal</em> or steaks from a <em>fruit</em> or <em>veggie</em>. Steaks will <strong>always</strong> be apart of apatite as a <strong>thick</strong> bite of flavor.</p>

      <br>
      <h2>Ingrediants pt.2</h2>

          <li>Garlic</li>
          <li>Salt and Pepper</li>
        </ul>

    <br>
    <h2>Steps to Cooking</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Dice up a quarter of an onion and 2-3 garlic cloves and put in cold skillet with half inch chunk of butter</li>

        <li>Heat skillet up on medium-high heat and cover bottom with the melted butter and onions and garlic cooking, stirring around every 25 seconds or so</li>
        <li>Once butter is melted and skillet is hot, bring steak out of fridge and put it on the skillet</li>
